# note-taker

## Description

This project provides a live website where users can record notes to help organize tasks, lists, and information. It allows you to quickly write, save, and navigate between notes as you need, and will be saved for future use if needed.

## Installation

you will need node project manager (npm) in order to install express. Do so by typing npm -i into the command line interface (cli).

## Usage

To use this app, follow this link to the deployed app: https://git.heroku.com/secret-lowlands-91904.git and click the link in the middle to open your notes page, then using the input area on the write, add a title and content to a new note. Use the floppydisk icon in the top right once you have a title and content to save the note. You can select notes you have previously saved from the list on the left, or make a new note with the plus icon in the top right. If you no longer need a note, use the red trashcan icon to delete it.

Below is a screenshot demonstrating what the deployed notes page might look like.
